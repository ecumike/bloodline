# Bloodline

My design system I use for all my sites and apps. I use Tachyons because it allows the greatest flexibility and styling across all my tools. 

## Requirements: 

Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download

Gulp: `npm install -g gulp`


## Install

```
npm install
```

## Developing

```
npm start
```

Fire it up. It will run a full build and then open the design site in your default browser and watch for changes. Any changes made to src files will auto-reload the page.


Individual files, as well as a bundled CSS and JS files are generated inside the `build` directory.
